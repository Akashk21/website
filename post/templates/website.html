  <h2 class="project-section project-intro">Information</h2>
  <p>The reason to create my personal website from scratch comes from not being able to find any project to create <strong>static websites</strong> that met my requirements.</p>
  <p>In my first iteration of my personal website (blog) I used <strong>blogspot</strong>. It is great for a quick start, but I did not like the stiffness of the platform regarding changes.</p>
  <p>The next iteration of my personal website (blog again) I used <strong>Jekyll</strong>. It has more freedom to perform changes and personalize it. However, at some point I wanted to add some features to the theme I was using. That implied learning <strong>Jekyll</strong>'s theme creating process and since I do not know <strong>Ruby</strong> it was quite hard.</p>
  <p>So, for my current iteration of my personal website (website and blog) I decided to search for alternatives such as <strong>Pelican</strong> to create <strong>static websites</strong>, but I did not like how the themes were created. Therefore, the last option was to create it myself (how hard can it be?).</p>
  <h2 class="project-section project-description">Description</h2>
  <p>To be honest it took longer (6 months) and was harder than I though it would be :D. The backend was relatively easy (it only took one month and a half), but since I do not have much knowledge of CSS or HTML design the frontend was what took the longer.</p>
  <p>The backend of my website uses <strong>Django</strong>, and <strong>SQLite</strong> (PostgreSQL can be used easily thanks to Django configuration) to store the required information.</p>
  <p>The frontend it is based on <a href="https://github.com/poole/hyde">Hyde</a> a <strong>Jekyll theme</strong>. The basic CSS is taken from that theme, and I extended it to make use of it in other ways in the website.</p>
  <p>I did not used JavaScript (besides adding Disqus, Social Media Buttons, etc) in the development of the website for two reasons: I wanted a simple website and I do not know JavaScript :D.</p>
