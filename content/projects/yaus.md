**YAUS**, **Y**et **A**nother **U**RL **S**hortener, was first written in Python3 using the [Flask](https://palletsprojects.com/p/flask/) web framework, and deployed in [Heroku](https://heroku.com): [https://yaus.dev](https://yaus.dev). The code of that version can be seen here: [https://github.com/maitesin/yaus/tree/e938b0d218849f50df7ab5a4a46923faf235762b](https://github.com/maitesin/yaus/tree/e938b0d218849f50df7ab5a4a46923faf235762b). However, the project has been rewritten in Go and I have applied some Domain Driven Design (DDD) and Command Query Segregation (CQS) patterns.

The purpose of this project is for me to tinker and practice some development methods or design I want to test. It also helps me keep up to date with the [Heroku](https://heroku.com) platform.
